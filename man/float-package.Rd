\title{32-Bit Floats}
\description{
R comes with a suite of utilities for linear algebra with "numeric"
(double precision) vectors/matrices. However, sometimes single precision (or
less!) is more than enough for a particular task.  This package extends R's
linear algebra facilities to include 32-bit float (single precision) data.
Float vectors/matrices have half the precision of their "numeric"-type but
are generally faster to numerically operate on, for a performance vs
accuracy trade-off.  The internal representation is an S4 class, which
allows us to keep the syntax identical to that of base R's.  Interaction
between floats and base types for binary operators is generally possible; in
these cases, type promotion always defaults to the higher precision.  The
package ships with copies of the single precision 'BLAS' and 'LAPACK', which
are automatically built in the event they are not available on the system.
