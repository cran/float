Source based on LAPACK 3.10.0

Single precision (and some support routines not available in the stock R
blas/lapack) are combined into:

* sblas.f
* slapack1-4.f
* sf90.f90

See combiner.sh for full details.

Additionally, the following routines have been modified for CRAN compliance:
* SSYTRD_SB2ST: pre-processor blocks commented out (no omp)
* LA_XISNAN: pre-processor blocks commented out (use ieee_arithmetic)
